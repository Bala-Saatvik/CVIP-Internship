# Customer Behavior Analysis Project

![Dashboard](https://github.com/Bala-Saatvik/CVIP-Internship/assets/94885375/29f9d344-36bd-45a2-8ce3-56c43b732e99)

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior based on transactional data, utilizing Jupyter Notebook and Microsoft Power BI. The primary objective is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

## Project Components

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook (`EDA on customer behaviour dataset.ipynb`) contains the data analysis process, exploration, and feature engineering steps. It utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to conduct a thorough examination of the transactional data.

#### Key Steps:

- **Data Loading:** Importing the necessary libraries and loading the transactional data.
- **Data Exploration:** Exploring the dataset's structure, examining statistical summaries, and visualizing key trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to facilitate deeper insights.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on common characteristics or behaviors.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying purchasing patterns and trends within the dataset.

### 2. Microsoft Power BI

The Power BI file (`EDA on customer transaction data.pbix`) complements the Jupyter Notebook by offering interactive and visually appealing dashboards. Power BI enables a user-friendly exploration of the derived insights, providing a more intuitive way to communicate the findings.

#### Dashboard Highlights:

- **Customer Segmentation:** Visual representation of customer groups based on the analysis.
- **Purchase Patterns:** Dynamic charts illustrating purchasing trends over time.
- **Product Preferences:** Graphics showcasing popular products and customer preferences.
- **Key Metrics:** Displaying essential metrics such as average transaction value, frequency, and recency.

## How to Use

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
    - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
    - Open the `EDA on customer behaviour dataset.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
    - Execute each cell to run the analysis step by step.

2. **Microsoft Power BI:**
    - Download and install Microsoft Power BI Desktop if you haven't already.
    - Open the `EDA on customer transaction data.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
    - Interact with the dashboards to explore the insights visually.

## Dependencies

- Jupyter Notebook: Python 3, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
