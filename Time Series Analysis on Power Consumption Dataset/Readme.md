## Task: Time Series Analysis

Embark on a time series analysis project using a dataset with a time component, specifically historical power consumption data. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the temporal data, enabling a better understanding of power consumption fluctuations over time.

### Project Highlights:

- **Dataset Selection:** Utilize a dataset containing historical power consumption data.
- **Time Series Exploration:** Analyze temporal patterns and trends in power consumption.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features for modeling power consumption trends.
- **Model Building:** Develop time series models for predicting power consumption.

## Task: Customer Behavior Analysis

Develop a data analysis project that focuses on understanding and analyzing customer behavior based on power consumption data. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer energy usage patterns, preferences, and overall behavior.

### Project Highlights:

- **Data Loading:** Import and explore the power consumption dataset.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze customer energy usage behavior, preferences, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derive additional features for deeper insights.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Group customers based on common energy usage characteristics.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify energy consumption patterns and trends.

## Tools Used:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Python-based interactive data analysis.
- **Power BI:** Business Intelligence tool for creating interactive visualizations.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks (`Time Series Analysis on Power Consumption Dataset.ipynb`) for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis process. Additionally, check out the Power BI file (`Time Series Analysis Power Consumption.pbix`) for interactive dashboards.
